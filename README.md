A couple of applications for simplifying calculations in game Ikariam:
	IkariamZid - Simple calculator to find out requirements to pierce a wall. It has Slovene and English localisation
	IkariamTrain - A somewhat more complex calculator used for determining number of troops needed to survive a specific amount of time, their cost and training time. Data can be exported into a text file for later use.
	IkariamPopulation - Calculates how long until city population reaches maximum based on several parameters.
